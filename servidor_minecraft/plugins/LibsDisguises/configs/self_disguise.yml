# If this is enabled and the server is 1.20.6+, players will be given the scale attribute to scale them up/down to the disguise's size
# This will only work on living disguises, and is false by default due to the possibility of abuse as it'd shrink hitboxes and the like
# This may behave unexpectably if you're playing with other scaling modifiers outside of this plugin!
# An example of what this setting does, is if you disguise as a cat you will be scaled down so your viewpoint is at the same height of an actual cat
# The player's move, jump, etc is unchanged

# The following two settings controls the min and max scale that can be applied to a self disguise so that the player's viewpoint will shrink/grow to match.
# This means they will not shrink below the min, and will not grow beyond the max

TallSelfDisguises: false

# This setting which is for servers that are 1.20.6+, allows the server to scale down the self disguise instead of hiding it completely
# If a player looks down, they'll see a mini figure of the previously large disguise
# This setting only works if the disguise wouldn't be shown as it's too tall, aka the above setting is false
# This will only work on living disguises!
